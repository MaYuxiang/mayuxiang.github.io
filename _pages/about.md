I am currently an associate professor in the School of Computer and Information Engineering at Henan University.

I love traveling, photography, reading, collecting stamps, collecting park tickets, running and swimming.

I have traveled to 28 provinces and more than 150 tourist cities in China.

I have participated in the marathon twice and completed the full marathon (42.195 kilometres) in four hours and fifteen minutes.
